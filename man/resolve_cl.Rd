\usage{
resolve_cl(
  cl.g,
  cl.med,
  markers,
  dat,
  map.dat,
  select.cells,
  p = 0.7,
  low.th = 0.2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cl.g}{all clusters}

\item{cl.med}{cluster medians}

\item{markers}{gene markers}

\item{dat}{normalized data of the REFERENCE data set}

\item{map.dat}{normalized data of the MAPPING data set.  Default is to map the data onto itself.}

\item{select.cells}{which cells to use?}

\item{p}{proportion of marker genes to include in each iteration of the mapping algorithm.}

\item{low.th}{the minimum difference in Pearson correlation required to decide on which branch
to map to. otherwise, a random branch is chosen.}
}
\value{
a vector of the mapped cluster
}
\description{
Returns the mapped cluster call of each cell to each leaf. This function is called by map_dend
