\usage{
fractionCorrectPerNode(
  dendIn,
  clActual,
  clPredict,
  minCount = 0.1,
  defaultSum = -1,
  out = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dendIn}{dendrogram for mapping.  Ignored if minimizeHeight=FALSE}

\item{clActual}{character vector of actual cluster assignments}

\item{clPredict}{character vector of predicted cluster assignments}

\item{minCount}{set to 0 results from clusters with fewer than this number of cells (default
is to consider all clusters)}

\item{defaultSum}{value to return in cases where there are fewer than minCount cells in the
actual cluster (e.g., cases that aren't considered at all)}

\item{out}{required for recursive function.  Do not set!}
}
\value{
matrix of two columns: (1) node name and (2) the fraction of cells in that node that
  are correctly assigned
}
\description{
This function returns the fraction correctly assigned to each node (as defined that the actual
  and predicted cluster are both in the same node)
}
