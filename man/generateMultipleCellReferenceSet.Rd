\title{Generate reference set of pseudo-cells}
\usage{
generateMultipleCellReferenceSet(
  refDat,
  clustersF,
  genesToUse = rownames(refDat),
  cellsPerMerge = 5,
  numberOfMerges = 10,
  mergeFunction = rowMedians,
  seed = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{refDat}{normalized data of the REFERENCE data set}

\item{clustersF}{factor indicating which cluster each cell type is actually assigned to in the reference data set}

\item{cellsPerMerge}{Number of cells to include in each combo cell}

\item{numberOfMerges}{Number of combo cells to include per cell type}

\item{mergeFunction}{function for combining cells into combo cells (use rowMeans or rowMedians)}

\item{seed}{for resproducibility}

\item{genesToMap}{which genes to include in the correlation mapping}
}
\value{
list where first element is data matrix of multi-cells by genes and
  second element is a vector of corresponding clusters
}
\description{
Creates a new reference set as input for cellToClusterMapping_byRank, where each 'cell' is the
  combiniation of several cells and this is run several times using different subsets of cells.
