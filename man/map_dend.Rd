\usage{
map_dend(
  dend,
  cl,
  dat,
  map.dat,
  select.cells,
  p = 0.8,
  low.th = 0.2,
  default.markers = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dend}{dendrogram for mapping}

\item{cl}{factor indicating which cluster each cell type is actually assigned to
in the reference data set}

\item{dat}{normalized data of the REFERENCE data set}

\item{map.dat}{normalized data of the MAPPING data set.  Default is to map the
data onto itself.}

\item{p}{proportion of marker genes to include in each iteration of the mapping
algorithm.}

\item{low.th}{the minimum difference in Pearson correlation required to decide
on which branch to map to. otherwise, a random branch is chosen.}

\item{default.markers}{not used}
}
\value{
a matrix of confidence scores (from 0 to 100) with rows as cells and columns
  as tree node/leafs.  Values indicate the fraction of permutations in which the cell
  mapped to that node/leaf using the subset of cells/genes in map_dend
}
\description{
Returns the mapping membership of each cell to each node and leaf using a
  tree-based method.  This is a wrapper function for map_dend.
