\arguments{
\item{mapDat}{normalized data of the mapping (=reference) data set.}

\item{medianDat}{representative value for each leaf.  If not entered, it is calculated}

\item{clustersF}{cluster calls for each cell.}

\item{panelSize}{number of genes to include in the marker gene panel}

\item{subSamp}{number of random nuclei to select from each cluster (to increase speed);
set as NA to not subsample}

\item{maxFcGene}{maximum number of genes to consider at each iteration (to increase speed)}

\item{qMin}{minimum quantile for fold change comparison (between 0 and 1, higher = more
specific marker genes are included)}

\item{seed}{for reproducibility}

\item{currentPanel}{starting panel.  Default is NULL.}

\item{panelMin}{if there are fewer genes than this, the top number of these genes by fc
rank are set as the starting panel.  Cannot be less than 2.}

\item{writeText}{should gene names and marker scores be output (default TRUE)}

\item{corMapping}{if TRUE (default) map by correlation; otherwise, map by Euclidean
distance (not recommended)}

\item{optimize}{if 'FractionCorrect' (default) will seek to maximize the fraction of
cells correctly mapping to final clusters
if 'CorrelationDistance' will seek to minimize the total distance between actual
cluster calls and mapped clusters
if 'DendrogramHeight' will seek to minimize the total dendrogram height between
actual cluster calls and mapped clusters}

\item{clusterDistance}{only used if optimize='CorrelationDistance'; a matrix (or
vector) of cluster distances.  Will be calculated if NULL and if clusterGenes
provided. (NOTE: order must be the same as medianDat and/or have column and row
names corresponding to clusters in clustersF)}

\item{clusterGenes}{a vector of genes used to calculate the cluster distance.
Only used if optimize='CorrelationDistance' and clusterDistance=NULL.}

\item{dend}{only used if optimize='DendrogramHeight' dendrogram; will error out of not provided}

\item{percentSubset}{for each iteration the function can subset the set of possible
genes to speed up the calculation.}
}
\value{
an ordered character vector corresponding to the marker gene panel
}
\description{
This is the primary function that iteratively builds a marker gene panel, one gene at a
  time by iteratively adding the most informative gene to the existing gene panel.
