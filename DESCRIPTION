Title: Building Gene Sets and Mapping mFISH Data
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Jeremy Miller <jeremym@alleninstitute.org>
Maintainer: Jeremy Miller <jeremym@alleninstitute.org>
Description: This repository includes code for gene selection for spatial transcriptomics methods and for mapping of spatial transcriptomics (or RNA-Seq data) onto a RNA-Seq reference. Specific topics include:
    1) Correlation-based mapping of cells to reference cell types
    2) Iterative building of gene panels a greedy algorithm with pre-defined constraints
    3) Visualizations related to gene mapping a gene panel selection
